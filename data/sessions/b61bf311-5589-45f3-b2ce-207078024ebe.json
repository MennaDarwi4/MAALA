It was introduced in a 2017 paper by Vaswani et al. and has since become a widely used and influential model in natural language processing (NLP) and other areas of machine learning. The Transformer architecture is designed to handle sequential data, such as text or speech, and is particularly well-suited for tasks like language translation, text summarization, and question answering. It replaces traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with self-attention mechanisms, allowing for parallelization and faster training times.",
