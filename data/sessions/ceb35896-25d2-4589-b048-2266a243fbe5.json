The transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, has undergone significant developments, with new applications emerging in 2023 and 2024, such as image and video generators like DALL-E, Stable Diffusion 3, and Sora, which use transformers to analyze input data. The use of transformers has also been explored in other areas, including grid transformers, where they have been shown to improve performance and life. Additionally, transformers have been applied to reinforcement learning, with surveys and studies published in 2023. Overall, the current state of transformer research is characterized by its relentless pace of innovation, with new developments and applications emerging continuously.
